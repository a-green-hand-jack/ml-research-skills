# AGENTS.md

Guidance for AI coding agents working in this repository.

## Repository Overview

This repo is **ml-research-skills** — a collection of agent skills for ML researchers. Each skill lives under `skills/<skill-name>/` as an instruction bundle centered on `SKILL.md`, with optional `scripts/` and `templates/` directories.

Skills in this repo are installed with:

```bash
npx skills add a-green-hand-jack/ml-research-skills
```

To install globally for both Codex and Claude Code:

```bash
npx skills add a-green-hand-jack/ml-research-skills -g -a codex claude-code -y
```

To install one specific skill globally for both agents:

```bash
npx skills add a-green-hand-jack/ml-research-skills -g -a codex claude-code -s remote-project-control -y
```

These files are primarily agent instructions and templates, not an application with automated runtime tests.

| `project-sync` | Sync experiment results from the code repo into the paper's `daily_experiments.tex` |
| `new-workspace` | Create a Git branch or project-aware component worktree for code experiments, baselines, rebuttal fixes, paper venue versions, arXiv releases, and camera-ready paper versions |

| `experiment-report-writer` | Write structured experiment reports from notes, configs, logs, metrics, tables, and figures |
| `advisor-update-writer` | Write decision-oriented advisor, mentor, lab meeting, or collaborator updates from evidence, risks, options, asks, and next actions |
| `research-slide-deck-builder` | Design and write research slide decks for advisor, lab, progress, reading, proposal, and conference talks using the external `progress-slides` template |

## Adding or Updating a Skill

Skills live in `skills/<skill-name>/` and must include a `SKILL.md` with YAML frontmatter:

```markdown
---
name: skill-name
description: One sentence describing when to use this skill. Include trigger phrases.
allowed-tools: Read, Write, Edit, Bash, Glob
---

# Skill Title

Brief description.

## When to Use This Skill
...

## Steps
...
```

Guidelines:
- The directory name must exactly match the `name` field.
- `name` must use lowercase letters, numbers, and hyphens only.
- Keep `SKILL.md` under 500 lines; move large references into linked files.
- Use `scripts/` for shell automation so the agent can run commands without embedding large shell blocks inline.
- Use `templates/` for files the skill writes into user projects.
- Write the `description` as a routing rule, not a title. Agents use it to decide when to activate the skill.
- Keep examples and venue/tooling references aligned with the actual templates and scripts shipped in the same skill directory.

## Validation

There are no automated tests in this repository. Before manual validation, run the local repository sanity check:

```bash
python3 scripts/validate_skills.py
```

This covers frontmatter, helper references, top-level skill inventory consistency, template placeholder format, and basic Python/shell syntax.

For the `init-python-project` scaffold smoke test, run:

```bash
python3 -m unittest -v tests.test_init_python_project_scaffold
```

Then validate changes by exercising the skill in the target agent runtime:

1. Install the skill with `npx skills add`, such as `npx skills add a-green-hand-jack/ml-research-skills -g -a codex claude-code -s <skill-name> -y`
2. Invoke it by describing a matching task
3. Check that the generated instructions, scripts, and templates behave as intended

## Notes for Agents

- Prefer updating the minimum set of files needed when a skill changes.
- If you change a skill's behavior, also check whether `README.md` and `CLAUDE.md` now need corresponding updates.
- Treat `SKILL.md`, helper scripts, and templates as a single unit; avoid documenting behavior that the shipped assets do not actually support.
