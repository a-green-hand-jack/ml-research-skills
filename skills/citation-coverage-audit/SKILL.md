# Citation Coverage Audit

Audit whether a draft paper cites the works it should cite. This skill is about reference completeness: classic foundations, closest prior work, current concurrent work, benchmark/dataset/method attributions, and reviewer-sensitive omissions.

Use this skill when:

- the user has a draft paper but suspects the reference list is incomplete
- a related work section may miss classic or recent work
- the paper needs to cite concurrent arXiv/OpenReview papers before submission
- the paper makes novelty claims that require stronger citation support
- the user wants to reduce reviewer complaints like "missing important related work"

Do not use this as a replacement for `citation-audit`. Use `citation-audit` after this skill to verify that added BibTeX entries and citation keys are correct.

Pair this skill with `research-project-memory` when missing citations affect novelty, baseline, related-work, or reviewer-risk tracking.

## Progressive Loading

- Always read `references/coverage-taxonomy.md` and `references/discovery-protocol.md`.
- Read `references/report-template.md` when writing the audit output.
- Read `references/memory-model.md` when saving or reusing topic-specific citation coverage knowledge.
- Use current web search for recent and concurrent work. Do not rely on static memory for "latest" or "recent" citations.

## Core Principles

- Missing close citations are submission risks. Treat them as reviewer-facing problems, not bibliography trivia.
- Separate classic foundations, closest prior work, and recent concurrent work. They serve different rhetorical and reviewer functions.
- Search from the paper's claims, not just keywords. A method paper, benchmark paper, theory paper, and empirical study need different citation coverage.
- Prefer primary sources: official papers, proceedings pages, arXiv, OpenReview, ACL Anthology, PMLR, CVF, ACM, IEEE, Springer, Semantic Scholar, DBLP, and authors' project pages.
- Do not pad the bibliography. Recommend citations only when they support a specific sentence, section, baseline, dataset, method component, theorem, or novelty boundary.
- Mark uncertainty. If a candidate looks relevant but cannot be verified, list it as `needs-author-review`.

## Step 1 - Define Scope

Identify:

- target venue and year
- topic and subtopic
- paper archetype: method, theory, empirical study, benchmark/dataset, systems, analysis, application, or hybrid
- paper stage: outline, full draft, final submission, rebuttal, camera-ready
- current source format: LaTeX, PDF, Markdown, notes
- search horizon for recent work, such as last 6 months, last 12 months, or since the previous conference deadline
- whether the user wants a report only or also BibTeX/prose patch suggestions

Default search horizon:

- for active ML/AI topics: last 12 months
- for fast-moving topics such as foundation models, diffusion, reasoning, agents, alignment, or multimodal learning: last 6-9 months plus current OpenReview submissions if accessible
- for theory or mature topics: include classics and last 24 months

## Step 2 - Extract Paper Claims and Existing Coverage

Read the draft and extract:

- title and abstract
- contribution bullets
- introduction novelty claims
- related work categories
- method components
- theorem assumptions or proof techniques
- datasets, benchmarks, metrics, and baselines
- experiment comparison points
- limitation and scope claims
- current citation keys and BibTeX entries

Build a paper citation map:

```markdown
## Paper Citation Map
- Main claim:
- Core method/theory:
- Closest related work currently cited:
- Classic foundations currently cited:
- Recent/concurrent work currently cited:
- Datasets/benchmarks currently cited:
- Baselines currently cited:
- Novelty claims requiring citation support:
- Sections with thin citation coverage:
```

If the draft is incomplete, audit the available claims and mark missing context.

## Step 3 - Classify Required Citation Categories

Read `references/coverage-taxonomy.md`.

For the paper, define required buckets:

- foundational classics
- closest prior work
- direct competitors
- concurrent work
- benchmark/dataset/metric sources
- method/tooling components
- theory/proof technique sources
- negative or limitation-related citations
- surveys or taxonomy papers
- venue-specific or community-standard citations

For each bucket, state why it matters for reviewer perception.

## Step 4 - Discover Missing Work

Read `references/discovery-protocol.md`.

Search iteratively:

1. use the paper's own title/claim keywords
2. search each method component and baseline
3. search closest cited papers forward and backward when possible
4. search recent arXiv/OpenReview/proceedings for the topic
5. search venue-specific accepted/oral/spotlight papers if the target venue matters
6. inspect surveys or benchmark leaderboards for canonical citations

For recent/concurrent work, include access dates and search queries. Search results change over time.

Do not recommend a paper only because it shares keywords. Each candidate must map to a citation role.

## Step 5 - Evaluate Candidate Relevance

For each candidate missing paper, classify:

- `must-cite`: close prior work, direct competitor, foundational citation, dataset/metric/source attribution, or work required to support/qualify a novelty claim
- `should-cite`: relevant recent work, adjacent strong baseline, useful survey, or important related line reviewers may expect
- `optional`: context or breadth citation that improves related work but is unlikely to affect review
- `do-not-cite`: keyword match but not scientifically relevant
- `needs-author-review`: relevance plausible but not enough evidence to decide

For every `must-cite` or `should-cite`, specify:

- where to cite it
- what claim it supports or qualifies
- how it changes novelty framing
- whether it needs BibTeX
- whether it suggests new experiments or baselines

## Step 6 - Check Novelty and Reviewer Risk

For each novelty claim, ask:

- Is the closest prior work cited?
- Is the difference stated correctly?
- Would a reviewer expect this missing paper?
- Does the missing paper weaken the novelty claim?
- Does it require a new baseline, ablation, theorem comparison, or discussion?

Risk levels:

- `blocking`: missing citation could make a novelty claim look false or unethical
- `high`: reviewer likely complains about missing related work
- `medium`: omission weakens positioning but probably not fatal
- `low`: useful completeness citation

## Step 7 - Produce Coverage Report

Use `references/report-template.md`.

The report should include:

- paper citation map
- search strategy and search date
- candidate missing citations
- must-cite and should-cite recommendations
- exact insertion points
- novelty-framing updates
- baseline/experiment implications
- unresolved author decisions

If the user wants a saved report and gives no path, use:

```text
docs/reports/citation_coverage_audit_YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

## Step 8 - Optional BibTeX and Text Patches

If the user asks for edits:

- add BibTeX only from verified metadata
- insert citations at the smallest safe location
- do not make broad related-work rewrites unless asked
- do not cite papers you have not verified enough to identify
- after edits, run or recommend `citation-audit` to verify keys and metadata

When exact prose is uncertain, write a suggested sentence in the report instead of editing the paper.

## Step 9 - Update Citation Coverage Memory

Read `references/memory-model.md`.

When a topic scan was performed:

1. update `.agent/citation-coverage/topics/<topic-slug>.md`
2. update `.agent/citation-coverage/project-coverage.md`
3. record search queries, access dates, candidate papers, and decisions

Memory must separate:

- canonical papers for the topic
- recent/concurrent papers with access dates
- papers already cited
- papers intentionally not cited
- unresolved author decisions

If the project uses `research-project-memory`, also update:

- `memory/risk-board.md`: missing closest-work, classic, benchmark, baseline, or concurrent-work risks
- `memory/action-board.md`: add-citation, check-bibtex, add-baseline, revise-novelty, or author-review actions
- `memory/claim-board.md`: novelty claims that must be weakened or qualified
- `memory/evidence-board.md`: citation evidence for claims when a paper directly supports or limits a claim
- `paper/.agent/paper-status.md`: related-work sections or insertion points that need edits

Use `needs-verification` for candidate papers not yet read deeply enough.

## Final Sanity Check

Before finalizing:

- classic, closest, and recent/concurrent work were considered separately
- search queries and dates are recorded
- every recommended paper has a citation role
- must-cite recommendations include insertion points
- novelty risks are explicit
- uncertain candidates are not presented as verified
- any edits are followed by a recommendation to run `citation-audit`
