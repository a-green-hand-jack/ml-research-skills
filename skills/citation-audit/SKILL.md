# Citation Audit

Run a pre-submission audit of citations, BibTeX entries, and LaTeX cross-references. This skill is for checking correctness before submission, not for broad literature discovery.

Use this skill when a paper already has draft citations and the user wants confidence that:

- every `\cite{...}` key in TeX exists in BibTeX
- every BibTeX entry is syntactically valid and not duplicated
- every `\ref{...}`, `\cref{...}`, `\eqref{...}`, `\autoref{...}` target exists
- every `\label{...}` is unique and follows the local naming convention
- DOI, arXiv, OpenReview, URL, title, author, year, and venue metadata match the real paper
- citation claims in nearby prose are actually supported by the cited work
- bibliography style is submission-ready

Pair this with `submit-paper` for the broader submission checklist. Pair it with `research-project-memory` when citation correctness issues should become blocking paper risks or actions.

## Skill Directory Layout

```text
<installed-skill-dir>/
├── SKILL.md
├── scripts/
│   └── audit_latex_refs.py
└── references/
    ├── citation-claim-audit.md
    ├── metadata-verification.md
    └── report-template.md
```

## Progressive Loading

- Always run `scripts/audit_latex_refs.py` for deterministic TeX/BibTeX/reference checks.
- Read `references/metadata-verification.md` when checking DOI, arXiv, OpenReview, proceedings, or publisher metadata.
- Read `references/citation-claim-audit.md` when the user asks whether citations support the claims made in the paper, or when doing a full pre-submission audit.
- Use `references/report-template.md` for the final audit report.

## Step 1 - Locate Paper Sources

Determine:

- paper root
- main TeX file
- all included TeX files
- BibTeX files referenced by `\bibliography{...}` or `\addbibresource{...}`
- target venue and submission mode if obvious

Useful local checks:

```bash
find . -maxdepth 4 -name "*.tex" -o -name "*.bib"
find . -maxdepth 3 -name "main.tex" -o -name "paper.tex"
```

If the user provides a paper directory, use it. If no main file is provided, prefer `main.tex`, then `paper.tex`, then the TeX file containing `\begin{document}`.

## Step 2 - Run Deterministic Local Audit

Run:

```bash
python3 <citation-audit-skill-dir>/scripts/audit_latex_refs.py --paper-dir "$PAPER_DIR" --main "$MAIN_TEX"
```

Use an absolute path to the installed skill script. Do not assume a Claude-specific install path.

The script checks:

- included TeX file discovery
- citation keys in `\cite`, `\citet`, `\citep`, `\citealp`, `\citeauthor`, `\citeyear`, `\textcite`, `\parencite`
- BibTeX keys and basic syntax
- missing citation keys
- unused BibTeX entries
- duplicate BibTeX keys
- missing bibliography files
- duplicate labels
- undefined references
- labels that are never referenced
- unresolved LaTeX placeholders such as `??` and citation placeholders such as `[?]`

If the script reports blocking issues, fix or report those before doing web metadata checks. Metadata validation is much less useful if the TeX/BibTeX graph is broken.

## Step 3 - Classify Findings

Use this severity model:

- `blocking`: missing cited key, duplicate BibTeX key, undefined ref, duplicate label, invalid BibTeX structure, broken DOI for a cited work
- `important`: metadata mismatch, wrong venue/year, likely duplicate entry, citation claim not supported, arXiv cited when peer-reviewed version should be cited
- `warning`: unused BibTeX entry, unreferenced label, inconsistent key naming, missing optional DOI/URL
- `note`: style cleanup, capitalization, field normalization, BibTeX key rename suggestion

Do not treat unused BibTeX entries as blocking unless the target venue or user requires a minimal bibliography.

## Step 4 - Verify Metadata

Read `references/metadata-verification.md`.

For every cited key, verify the best available identifier:

- DOI through publisher/CrossRef/doi.org
- arXiv ID through arXiv
- OpenReview URL or forum ID through OpenReview
- proceedings URL for NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, ACL Anthology, CVF, ACM, IEEE, Springer, or PMLR

Check:

- title
- author list or first author + author count
- year
- venue or publication status
- DOI/arXiv/OpenReview/proceedings URL
- whether a peer-reviewed version exists

When metadata cannot be verified, mark it explicitly instead of guessing.

## Step 5 - Audit Citation Claims

Read `references/citation-claim-audit.md` for full guidance.

For each citation context, classify what the prose asks the citation to support:

- background fact
- prior method existence
- closest related work
- empirical result
- theoretical result
- dataset or benchmark
- negative claim or limitation
- comparison or state-of-the-art claim

Then check whether the cited paper actually supports that role. For high-risk claims, inspect the abstract, introduction, method/result section, and if needed the PDF.

High-risk contexts:

- "first", "only", "state-of-the-art", "significantly", "provably", "guarantees"
- claims about a paper's results or limitations
- citations used to justify a baseline choice
- citations used for theory assumptions
- citations in contribution bullets or problem motivation

Do not silently rewrite scientific claims. If a citation does not support a claim, propose one of:

- replace citation
- weaken claim
- add a more specific citation
- move the claim to related work
- mark as needing author confirmation

## Step 6 - Fix Safe Issues

Safe auto-fixes:

- add missing `.bib` extension resolution in the report
- remove obvious duplicate BibTeX entries only after confirming they are truly identical
- normalize capitalization braces in titles
- add missing DOI/arXiv/URL fields when verified
- fix BibTeX field spelling
- rename labels or citation keys only if all TeX call sites are updated consistently

Never auto-fix:

- citation claims whose support is ambiguous
- substitution of one cited paper for another without explaining the scientific difference
- venue status when multiple versions exist
- author order if sources disagree

For any edit, keep the smallest possible diff.

## Step 7 - Write the Audit Report

Use `references/report-template.md`.

The final report should include:

- files checked
- local TeX/BibTeX graph status
- metadata verification status
- citation-claim support status
- blocking fixes required before submission
- recommended non-blocking cleanup
- unresolved items requiring author judgment

If the user asks for a saved report and gives no path, use:

```text
docs/reports/citation_audit_YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

## Step 8 - Final Sanity Check

Before finalizing:

- all cited keys resolve to exactly one BibTeX entry
- all required TeX references resolve to exactly one label
- blocking citation/reference problems are tracked as actions when project memory exists

## Step 9 - Write Back to Project Memory

If the project uses `research-project-memory`, update:

- `memory/risk-board.md`: blocking or important citation, metadata, label, reference, or citation-claim risks
- `memory/action-board.md`: concrete fixes for missing keys, metadata corrections, unsupported claims, or broken refs
- `memory/claim-board.md`: claims that must be weakened because citations do not support them
- `paper/.agent/paper-status.md`: citation-audit status and unresolved author decisions

Use `observed` for deterministic TeX/BibTeX graph findings and `needs-verification` for metadata or claim-support issues not fully checked.
- every blocking metadata issue is fixed or explicitly listed
- high-risk citation claims have been audited
- unresolved citation correctness questions are not hidden
- the final answer distinguishes deterministic script findings from web/semantic verification findings
