# Research Project Memory

Maintain project memory as a layered system, not a flat notes file. This skill gives agents a shared protocol for remembering what a research project is trying to prove, what evidence exists, what risks remain, and which component owns each next action.

Use this skill when:

- a project needs cross-session memory beyond remote execution state
- the user wants memory across `paper/`, `code/`, worktrees, `slides/`, reviewer simulation, or rebuttal
- claims, experiments, figures, paper sections, reviewer risks, and actions need to stay aligned
- a session materially changes project direction, evidence, writing, review risks, or planned experiments
- a new agent session needs bootstrap context before acting
- the user asks for a memory system, project state graph, claim/evidence board, worktree memory, or closeout protocol

This is a coordination skill. It does not replace `remote-project-control`, `experiment-design-planner`, `conference-writing-adapter`, `paper-reviewer-simulator`, or `rebuttal-strategist`; it tells them where and how to persist trusted project state.

## Progressive Loading

- Always read `references/memory-architecture.md`, `references/object-schemas.md`, and `references/writeback-protocol.md`.
- Read `references/consistency-checks.md` when asked to audit project state, prepare a milestone, submit, write, review, or rebut.
- Read `references/closeout-protocol.md` before ending a substantial session or updating memory after meaningful work.
- Use `templates/` as the source of truth when bootstrapping missing memory files.

## Core Principles

- Memory is coordination context, not execution truth.
- Stable claims, decisions, risks, and component mappings belong in repo memory.
- Volatile facts such as dirty git state, queue state, active jobs, and file existence must be re-verified.
- Every important claim should link to evidence, a paper location, and current risks.
- Every reviewer or rebuttal risk should link to an action, a decision to accept the risk, or a reason it is out of scope.
- Every worktree should have a purpose and an exit condition: merge, continue, park, or kill.
- Paper version worktrees should also record target venue/release, submission mode, template/style differences, source visibility, cleanup requirements, and compile workflow.
- Component-local memory is a rollup, not a replacement for project memory. `code/docs/ops/current-status.md` and `code/docs/ops/decision-log.md` can record code operational state, but cross-component and cross-worktree coordination should still be visible in root `memory/` and component `.agent/` indexes.
- Cross-worktree state has three levels: global registry in `memory/component-index.yaml`, component rollup in `<component>/.agent/worktree-index.md`, and leaf status in each `<component-worktree>/.agent/worktree-status.md`.
- GitHub Projects, when configured, are a collaborator-facing cloud board for issues, PRs, blockers, and roadmap/status views across component repos. They do not replace root `memory/`, component `.agent/`, or worktree memory.
- Mark certainty: `observed`, `user-stated`, `inferred`, `stale`, or `needs-verification`.
- Write memory at the most specific layer that will help the next session.

## Step 1 - Locate the Project and Existing Memory

Detect the project root:

```bash
git rev-parse --show-toplevel 2>/dev/null || pwd
```

Then inspect likely memory files:

- `memory/project.yaml`
- `memory/component-index.yaml`
- `memory/current-status.md`
- `memory/decision-log.md`
- `memory/claim-board.md`
- `memory/evidence-board.md`
- `memory/risk-board.md`
- `memory/action-board.md`
- `paper/.agent/`
- `paper/.agent/worktree-index.md`
- `code/.agent/`
- `code/.agent/worktree-index.md`
- `slides/.agent/`
- `reviewer/.agent/`
- `rebuttal/.agent/`
- GitHub Project URL/number in `memory/project.yaml`, if configured

If the project uses another layout, adapt the component paths but keep the same memory roles.

## Step 2 - Bootstrap Missing Memory

If the user asks to initialize memory, or if memory is missing and the task depends on it, create the minimum useful files from templates:

- `templates/memory/project.yaml` -> `memory/project.yaml`
- `templates/memory/component-index.yaml` -> `memory/component-index.yaml`
- `templates/memory/current-status.md` -> `memory/current-status.md`
- `templates/memory/decision-log.md` -> `memory/decision-log.md`
- `templates/memory/claim-board.md` -> `memory/claim-board.md`
- `templates/memory/evidence-board.md` -> `memory/evidence-board.md`
- `templates/memory/risk-board.md` -> `memory/risk-board.md`
- `templates/memory/action-board.md` -> `memory/action-board.md`
- `templates/component/component-status.md` -> `<component>/.agent/<component>-status.md`
- `templates/component/worktree-index.md` -> `<component>/.agent/worktree-index.md` when the component uses worktrees
- `templates/component/worktree-status.md` -> `<component-worktree>/.agent/worktree-status.md` when a code or paper worktree needs its own memory

Ask only for fields that cannot be inferred safely:

- project name
- project root
- component paths
- current research question
- current target venue or milestone, if any
- GitHub Project owner/title/URL/number, if the user wants cloud board integration
- whether memory files should be committed

## Step 3 - Build the Bootstrap Summary

Before substantial work, summarize:

- project name and root
- current research question and positioning
- target venue or milestone
- active components and paths
- current claim IDs
- current evidence IDs and latest reliable result
- top risks and blockers
- active actions and owners
- stale or missing memory
- facts that must be verified before acting

Keep the summary compact. Do not paste entire boards unless the user asks.

## Step 4 - Write to the Right Layer

Read `references/writeback-protocol.md`.

Use this routing:

- whole-project identity, target venue, component paths, memory policy -> `memory/project.yaml`
- GitHub Project board owner, URL, number, scope, and sync policy -> `memory/project.yaml`
- current focus, active milestone, next session entry point -> `memory/current-status.md`
- durable project decisions and why -> `memory/decision-log.md`
- paper claims and their status -> `memory/claim-board.md`
- experiments, analyses, proofs, citations, and figures that support claims -> `memory/evidence-board.md`
- reviewer, novelty, baseline, writing, execution, and rebuttal risks -> `memory/risk-board.md`
- concrete next tasks and owners -> `memory/action-board.md`
- component-specific state -> `<component>/.agent/<component>-status.md`
- global worktree registry and root paths -> `memory/component-index.yaml`
- component-local cross-worktree rollup -> `<component>/.agent/worktree-index.md`
- code worktree purpose, or paper version policy and exit condition -> `<worktree>/.agent/worktree-status.md`

When in doubt, write a short pointer at the project layer and details in the component layer.

## Step 5 - Maintain the Claim-Evidence-Risk-Action Graph

Read `references/object-schemas.md`.

Use stable IDs:

- `CLM-###`: claim
- `EVD-###`: evidence item
- `EXP-###`: experiment or run family
- `FIG-###`: figure or table
- `RSK-###`: risk
- `ACT-###`: action
- `DEC-###`: decision
- `WTR-###`: worktree
- `REV-###`: review or rebuttal issue

Every major update should preserve links:

```text
CLM-001 -> supported_by EVD-003 -> visualized_by FIG-002 -> threatened_by RSK-004 -> resolved_by ACT-007
```

Avoid orphan objects. If a claim has no evidence, mark it as `planned`, `unsupported`, or `cut`.

## Step 6 - Run Consistency Checks

Read `references/consistency-checks.md` when auditing memory.

Check for:

- paper claims without evidence
- evidence without a claim or paper location
- reviewer risks without actions
- rebuttal promises without paper/code follow-up
- worktrees without exit condition
- worktrees missing from the global registry or component worktree index
- stale results still used in writing
- slides that contradict paper status
- volatile state recorded as stable truth

Report mismatches as project risks or actions.

## Step 7 - Close Out the Session

Read `references/closeout-protocol.md`.

Before ending a substantial session, update:

- `memory/current-status.md`
- any changed claim/evidence/risk/action board
- relevant component status file
- worktree status file if a code branch direction or paper version policy changed
- component worktree index and `memory/component-index.yaml` if worktrees were added, closed, parked, merged, or killed
- `memory/decision-log.md` if a durable decision was made

Closeout should answer: what changed, what is trustworthy, what is stale, what should the next agent verify, and what is the next concrete action.

## Final Sanity Check

Before finalizing:

- stable and volatile facts are separated
- new claims link to evidence or are marked unsupported
- new evidence links to a claim, component, and source path
- new risks link to actions or accepted-risk decisions
- worktree memory has a purpose and exit condition
- active worktrees appear in both the root registry and the relevant component worktree index
- current-status gives the next session a clear starting point
- no private local path or credential is written into shared memory unless the user explicitly wants it
